# React Native TypeScript Starter

This repo is a simple template that integrates the goodness from this [awesome blog post](http://www.reactnative.tools/tutorials/2016/09/20/reactnative-ts/).

To use, clone this repo and run:

    yarn install
    yarn run build
    yarn run android

Once the android app is up and running, set up hot reload, and run:

    yarn run build -- --watch

That's it. At this point there should be hot reloading android goodness with auto-compiling typescript on save. Good times!
